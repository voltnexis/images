# VoltNexis Image Vault - Setup Instructions

## Supabase Setup

### 1. Create a Supabase Project

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create an account
2. Click "New Project"
3. Choose your organization and enter project details:
   - Name: `image-vault`
   - Database Password: (choose a strong password)
   - Region: (choose closest to your users)
4. Wait for the project to be created (2-3 minutes)

### 2. Get Your Project Credentials

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to Settings > API
2. Copy the following values:
   - **Project URL** (looks like: `https://xxxxx.supabase.co`)
   - **Anon public key** (starts with `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...`)

### 3. Configure Your Application

1. Open `supabase-config.js` in your project
2. Replace the placeholder values:
   ```javascript
   const SUPABASE_URL = 'YOUR_SUPABASE_URL'; // Replace with your Project URL
   const SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = 'YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY'; // Replace with your Anon key
   ```

### 4. Set Up Database Schema

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to the SQL Editor
2. Copy the entire content from `supabase-setup.sql`
3. Paste it into the SQL Editor and click "Run"
4. This will create:
   - `users` table for user profiles
   - `images` table for image metadata
   - Storage bucket for image files
   - Row Level Security policies
   - Sample data (optional)

### 5. Configure Storage

1. Go to Storage in your Supabase dashboard
2. You should see an `images` bucket created by the SQL script
3. The bucket is configured to be public for reading
4. Upload policies are set for authenticated users

## Image Format Handling

### Upload Process
1. User selects any image format (JPEG, PNG, GIF, etc.)
2. Client-side converts to WebP for efficient storage and display
3. Both WebP and original format are uploaded to Supabase
4. Database stores metadata for both versions

### Download Process
1. User clicks download button
2. System downloads the original format file
3. If original not available, converts WebP back to original format
4. File is downloaded in the user's original format

### Benefits
- **Faster Loading**: WebP images are 25-35% smaller than JPEG/PNG
- **Better UX**: Users get their files in original format when downloading
- **Storage Efficient**: WebP reduces bandwidth and storage costs
- **Universal Compatibility**: Fallback conversion ensures compatibility
